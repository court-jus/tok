# Tempest of Knowledge

**2 to 5 players**

## Components

* 2 "tempest" decks, each one contains 24 cards of 6 colors (4 per color) numbered 1 to 24
* The "locations" board with the 6 locations (colors)
* 6 pawns (one per color)
* Something for the players to secretly choose a location (could be cards, tokens or a smaller version of the locations board)

## Goal

The books of Prospero have been shuffled in the various libraries of the land. Players are hired by library managers to get them back. The first player to find his 4 books wins.

One of the deck will be used to represent the books in the libraries while the other deck is used for players objectives, goals.

It's a game of memory, deduction and some strategy and mind reading/double guessing.

## Setup

Each player chooses one color (location) and places his pawn on that location. The game will use another color (for example for 2 players, 3 colors will be used. The other cards are removed from the game).

Shuffle one deck and deal it face down to the locations (that piles are the libraries).

From the other deck, each player receives 3 cards matching his color plus a random card from the remaining.

Each player looks at his library, chooses 2 cards and put the other 2 back in any order (he chooses). The two cards taken are the player's backpack.

The top card of each library is turned face up.

## Flow of the game

Each round, player secretly choose one location they want to go to. Then all the chosen locations are revealed
and players move to their pawn.

Players now consult the library (pile of card) in the location they are, without merging it with their backpack.
They choose one card of the library and one card of the backpack to swap and put the library back in any order they want.
Finally the top card of the libraries are turned face up.

A new round begins

### What if two players choose the same location ?

The library is shuffled and dealt to the involved players (merged with the backpack this time).

The involved players now draft the cards (Choose one to keep, pass the remaining to the other player,
repeat until all the cards have been kept).

Finally they keep only two cards for their backpack, the others go back to the library that is shuffled
and put back with its top card face up.

## End of game

When a player can claim he has reached his goal with the cards in his hand plus the cards in his current library
matching his goal cards, he wins the game.
